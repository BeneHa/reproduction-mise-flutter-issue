# 34086

## Current behavior

Renovate tries to install flutter but is missing some permissions, logs e.g. [here]([https://github.com/BeneHa/minimal-reproduction-mise-flutter-issue/actions/runs/13201133704/job/36853176844#step:3:2118].
Also visible in the PRs [here](https://github.com/BeneHa/reproduction-mise-flutter-issue/pull/1).

## Expected behavior

Renovate is able to install flutter and create the PRs correctly.
